# FitLit
## Abstract
This is the first Pair project from Mod2 at Turing School of Software and Design. This program focuses on using Object-oriented programming **(OOP)** to perform data manipulation and test-driven development **(TDD)** to implement a robust testing suite. We were given data from an activity tracker that represents many users over many days. Think of something like Fitbit. The program allows users to see their latest activity data, goals, and milestones.

When the user opens the dashboard, they can view widgets with their profile, daily water, weekly water, hours slept last night, past seven days of sleep, activity today, activity this week, and a weekly step challenge between the user and their friends.

## Project Next Steps
In the creation of this project, we focused mainly on JavaScript functionality. Moving forward, we aim to create a more appealing and more interactive DOM. We'd like to create multiple pages the user can toggle between with categorized information on each page.

Right now, we have a user ID hard-coded into the JavaScript that references the information for a single user. To make this more useful, we'd like to have a search box or drop-down menu where you can select a specific user to view their information and dashboard.

## Setup
1. Fork and clone down this repo.
2. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory.
3. To view the application, open index.html in the browser.
